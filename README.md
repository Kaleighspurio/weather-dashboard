# weather-dashboard
This application allows the user to input a city and select a state within the US to get the current weather and 5 day forecast for the searched location.  The most recent search is stored in local storage and is appended as a button to the page when it is loaded or refreshed.  The user may click on buttons containing their past searches to view the weather for those locations again.
This application uses information from the OpenWeather API, and utilizes Bulma as a CSS framework.
